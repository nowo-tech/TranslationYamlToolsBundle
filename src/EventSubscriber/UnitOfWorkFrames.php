/**
 * Unit-of-work bookkeeping of a boundary subscriber (1.18.1, audit NM / NL2-v): which units run in this process, so
 * the subscriber acts only at the OUTERMOST boundary of a request, a Messenger message or a console command. Audit NX CR1–CR3: per-worker message state and a stack of main requests.
 *
 * A plain `++` on `console.command` / `--` on a late `console.terminate` leaked in a long-lived process: a terminate
 * listener that threw or stopped the propagation before the decrement, or a `console.error` listener that threw
 * (Symfony then skips `console.terminate`), left the depth above zero forever, so every later boundary gated on "no
 * command running" stopped clearing. Here, with every change made at PHP_INT_MAX:
 * - each console run is a FRAME on a stack, keyed by its Command object AND its input (a command that runs itself
 *   in-process has another input object per run). A frame saves the worker and request stacks when it is pushed and
 *   restores them when it is removed, so a message or a request that never ended inside a command does not outlive
 *   it; the end of a main request or a message removes the frames started inside it. A frame is the outermost unit
 *   when nothing ran when it was pushed;
 * - `console.terminate` removes ITS frame and the frames above it (nested runs that never terminated); a terminate
 *   without a frame removes nothing (never a blind decrement);
 * - `console.error` marks the frame as failing. The mark stays until the frame's own terminate removes it: when an
 *   error listener throws, Symfony never dispatches that terminate, and a still-marked frame is dropped (its saved
 *   state restored) at the next main request, Messenger event or command;
 * - main requests: a STACK of the main `Request` objects in flight (audit NX CR2). A main request is the outermost unit
 *   only when no other main request is in flight; `kernel.finish_request` / `kernel.terminate` pop their request and
 *   the requests above it (nested requests whose end never came), an unknown request pops nothing. A main request that
 *   is the HTTP kernel's own main request (its `RequestStack`, popped in a `finally`) drops the requests left on the
 *   stack by a request whose end never came (a throwing `kernel.exception` listener). `kernel.terminate` ends the
 *   outermost unit only when nothing runs any more (the terminate of a nested main request keeps the outer one, audit
 *   OB-L3);
 * - Messenger: a STACK of the running workers (`WorkerStartedEvent` → `WorkerStoppedEvent`), each with its message in
 *   flight (audit NX CR1). A worker run in-process inside a message handler gets its own entry, so its events never end
 *   the outer message. A message ends at handled / failed / `WorkerMessageSkipEvent` (dispatched only by
 *   `messenger:failed:retry`), at its worker's next `WorkerRunningEvent` (also dispatched after a message a listener
 *   skipped with `shouldHandle(false)`, audit NX CR3) or its worker's stop; a received event whose final
 *   `shouldHandle()` is false (read at PHP_INT_MIN) ends it too. A message received outside any worker the tracker saw
 *   start gets an entry without a worker. A message is the outermost unit when no other message is in flight. A run
 *   that aborted (an exception thrown out of `Worker::run()`: no handled, running or stopped event) is dropped as soon
 *   as its worker or its in-flight received event is gone (weak references, audits OB-M1 / OB-L1).
 *
 * The verdict of each boundary event ("did this unit start / end as the outermost one?") is kept per event object
 * (`WeakMap`), so the late listeners read the value computed when the event started, whatever ran in between.
 *
 * Every handler first drops the failing frames (restoring the state they saved) and only then writes its own state,
 * so a restored frame never overwrites the state the handler just wrote (audit NL2-v2).
 *
 * Process-lifetime state, bounded by the nesting depth; it holds no request data beyond the requests in flight and is
 * deliberately not reset by `kernel.reset` (it describes the units still running).
