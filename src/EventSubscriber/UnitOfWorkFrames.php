/**
 * Unit-of-work bookkeeping of a boundary subscriber (1.18.1, audit NM / NL2-v): which units run in this process, so
 * the subscriber acts only at the OUTERMOST boundary of a request, a Messenger message or a console command.
 *
 * A plain `++` on `console.command` / `--` on a late `console.terminate` leaked in a long-lived process: a terminate
 * listener that threw or stopped the propagation before the decrement, or a `console.error` listener that threw
 * (Symfony then skips `console.terminate`), left the depth above zero forever, so every later boundary gated on "no
 * command running" stopped clearing. Here, with every change made by the subscriber at PHP_INT_MAX:
 * - each console run is a FRAME on a stack, keyed by its Command object AND its input (a command that runs itself
 *   in-process has another input object per run). A frame saves the message flag and the request depth when it is
 *   pushed and restores them when it is removed, so a message or a request that never ended inside a command does not
 *   outlive it; the end of a main request or a message removes the frames started inside it. A frame is the outermost
 *   unit when nothing ran when it was pushed;
 * - `console.terminate` removes ITS frame and the frames above it (nested runs that never terminated); a terminate
 *   without a frame removes nothing (never a blind decrement);
 * - `console.error` marks the frame as failing. The mark stays until the frame's own terminate removes it: when an
 *   error listener throws, Symfony never dispatches that terminate, and a still-marked frame is dropped (its saved
 *   state restored) at the next main request, received message, command or worker stop;
 * - main requests are counted (a main request handled in-process inside another one does not end it early) and a
 *   Messenger message in flight is a flag (received → handled / failed / skipped / worker stopped).
 *
 * The console verdict ("did this run start as the outermost unit?") is kept per event object (`WeakMap`), so the
 * subscriber's late listeners read the value computed when the run started, whatever ran in between.
 *
 * Every handler first drops the failing frames (restoring the state they saved) and only then writes its own flag or
 * counter, so a restored frame never overwrites the state the handler just wrote (audit NL2-v2).
 *
 * Process-lifetime state, bounded by the nesting depth; it holds no request data and is deliberately not reset by
 * `kernel.reset` (it describes the units still running).
 *
